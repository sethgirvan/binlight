=========================

Firmware for ATtiny13 and ATtiny85 -based flashlight drivers that includes some
interesting features while still fitting in the meager 1KiB of flash program
memory on the ATtiny13.

A firmware initially designed for the ATTiny13A-based MTN-10DD board: A small
board that can fit in slim AAA/10440 flashlights such as the SingFire-348.
Written in AVR assembly.

Requirements
------------

 - avr-gcc
 - avr-libc
 - avr-binutils
 - avrdude (for flashing the microcontroller)

Learning AVR assembly
---------------------

In addition to the part datasheet and the AVR Instruction Set Manual, these are
some resources I found helpful in learning to program AVRs in assembly:

 - http://www.elektronik-labor.de/AVR/KursAssembler/T13asm13.html
   - A cute tutorial which also includes a brief introduction to the actual
     machine code and the SPI programming protocol.
   - In German, but I found the Google Translate English translation usable.
     - Sometimes the assembly source gets translated, so one may want to
       cross-reference the untranslated version there.
   - Does not use GNU as / avr-gcc, so you will want to reference
     https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/[the GNU as manual] (or `info as`).
 - http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/assembler.html
   - Example of how to use avr-gcc and avr-libc for assembly.
