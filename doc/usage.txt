Quick Modes
-----------
Quick modes are entered by cycling power to the driver multiple times in quick
succession: ie with on time less than the CFG_QUICK_TIME configuration and off
time less than the normal off time (which depends on the off time capacitance
used and the value of CFG_OFF_TIME_V_THRESH).

For example, from any mode the first quick mode can be entered by quickly
turning the light off and on in a sequence of off-on-off-on (or starting with
the light off, on-off-on), the second quick mode with a sequence of
off-on-off-on-off-on, etc.

They are called "quick modes" because they can be entered quickly from any other
mode by quickly tapping the power switch a number of times.

Note that when entering a quick mode, the next normal mode will be entered
intermediately until the power is cycled again. For this reason, it may be
desirable to use less bright modes for the normal modes and more bright modes
for the quick modes if one wants to avoid an intermediate bright flash when
switching to a less bright mode.

Special function mode
---------------------
 - Special function mode allows performing one of the following special
   functions:
   - vbat_indicate: Indicate battery voltage
   - eeprom_read: Read from EEPROM
   - eeprom_write: Write to EEPROM
   - off_time_set: Set the off-time
   Some special functions that might be implemented in the future:
   - Set timer
   - Stopwatch
   - Set Morse code buffer
   - Output from Morse code buffer

 - off_time_set
   After activating this special function, turn off the light for the desired
   new off-time then turn the light back on. Note that you may not want to use
   this special function while currently in off-time mode because if something
   goes wrong you may be unable to switch modes and thus unable to enter special
   function mode again to adjust things. In that case you will have to use the
   "unbrick" mode to reset things to a sane state. So it may be preferable to
   switch to on-time control before using this function.

Low battery indication blinks
-----------------------------
binlight can output a number of blinks on power-on and repeated periodically
to indicate a low battery condition. The frequency at which these low battery
indication blinks are repeated is set by CFG_BAT_LOW_BLINK_INTERVAL and the
voltages that the blinks occur at are set by CFG_VBAT_LOW_LVLS. Each
progressively lower level of CFG_VBAT_LOW_LVLS corresponds with the number of
blinks. ie between CFG_VBAT_LOW_LVLS[0] and CFG_VBAT_LOW_LVLS[1] the light
will blink just once, between CFG_VBAT_LOW_LVLS[1] and CFG_VBAT_LOW_LVLS[2]
the light will blink twice, etc.

Low battery dimming
-------------------
binlight can limit the maximum brightness during a low battery condition. The
maximum duty cycles are defined CFG_BAT_LOW_BRIGHT_LVLS which are activated
at the corresponding battery voltages defined by CFG_VBAT_LOW_LVLS. Bit 1
of CFG_FLAGS0 provides a global enable switch for low battery dimming, so
one can relatively quickly override low battery dimming on the fly by writing
this bit to 0 with eeprom_write.
