 - Quick Modes
   - Quick modes are entered by cycling power to the driver multiple times in
     quick succession: ie with on time less than the CFG_QUICK_TIME
     configuration and off time less than the normal off time (which depends on
     the off time capacitance used and the value of CFG_OFF_TIME_V_THRESH).

     For example, from any mode the first quick mode can be entered by quickly
     turning the light off and on in a sequence of off-on-off-on (or starting
     with the light off, on-off-on), the second quick mode with a sequence of
     off-on-off-on-off-on, etc.

     They are called "quick modes" because they can be entered quickly from any
     other mode by quickly tapping the power switch a number of times.

     Note that when entering a quick mode, the next normal mode will be entered
     intermediately until the power is cycled again. For this reason, it may
     be desirable to use less bright modes for the normal modes and more bright
     modes for the quick modes if one wants to avoid an intermediate bright
     flash when switching to a less bright mode.
