The quick mode system is partially inspired by the FOLOMOV EDC C1 flashlight
which supports a quick double-tap to enter the turbo mode and then cycle through
other special modes. I liked the ability to enter the maximum brightness quickly
from almost any other mode. However, the EDC C1 does not actually turn on the
light until after the time for another "quick tap" of the switch has expired.

I find this slight delay to turn on the light quite annoying, especially since
in the EDC C1, double-tapping the switch will only ever enter a brighter mode,
so briefly outputting an intermediary mode in between taps would eliminate this
delay without any downside in my opinion.

Thus, in order to minimize delay for the light to turn on, binlight is designed
to output the current mode even while waiting to see if it should enter a quick
mode. The main situation I see where this setup may be undesirable is when one
has configured quick modes that are significantly dimmer than the normal modes
because one will have to endure a brief, brighter flash of the intermediary
normal mode when entering a dimmer quick mode.
